# UTTET_Website

A website for the University of Toronto Tetris Club (work in progress).

Deployed at https://angelala3252.github.io/UTTET_Website/

The user should first click the play button and then use the left arrow, right arrow, and space buttons to move the yellow O piece to the link at the bottom of the Tetris board that they desire. This website currently only works on a laptop (with left and right arrow keys) as it requires an actual keyboard, but that will be fixed soon by adding clickable keys beside the Tetris board. 

TODO: 
- add clickable arrow keys and space buttons that change colour when the user presses the keyboard buttons 
- instead of redirect, open the link in a new window
- slow down the hard drop speed
- Add about page link to bottom right corner link with information about our club and current weekly meeting times and upcoming events
- add hover effect and padding to the play button
- Responsive design!!!
- Polish styling and improve aesthetics to look more like Tetris
- validate HTML and clean up code
- remove unused images
- add grid border
- add animation once yellow O block crushes the logo square
- use custom domain uttet.lol
- page icon
